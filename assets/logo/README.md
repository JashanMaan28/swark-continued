# Logo Assets

## About These Assets

These logo files are retained from the original Swark project for continuity and recognition purposes. The original Swark team created these assets.

If you are the original copyright holder and wish these to be changed or removed, please open an issue on this fork's repository.

## Files

- `swark-icon.png` - Extension icon used in VS Code Marketplace
- `swark-logo-dark-mode.png` - Logo for dark mode displays
- `swark-logo-light-mode.png` - Logo for light mode displays

## Future Plans

We may create distinct branding assets for this fork in the future to better differentiate "Swark Continued" from the original project, while maintaining proper attribution to the original work.
